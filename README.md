# Song Lyrics
In this JavaScript project Im searching for a song lyrics using Fetch API and an [external API](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search).

The user has to enter the artist and song and the app will connect to the API to search for the song lyrics.

**UPDATE: The external API its not working at the moment.**
